# Kendall Parasitism <br>

I collected a random sample of parasitized and unparasitized stink bugs (*Nezara viridula*) once a week for six weeks this summer from a cornfield in Alabama. 
These bugs had been parasitized by an endoparasitoid fly, *Trichopoda pennipes*. 
The bugs were given either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether or not a parasitoid larvae had emerged. 
We hoped to take data on **sex, date, location of bugs collected**, as well as how many **parasitoid eggs were laid on each bug, where eggs were laid on body and how long it took parasitoid larvae to emerge from host**. 
I also took data on **fecundity** of the parasitized vs the unparasitized bugs.  
We hoped to determine the parasitism rate in the field, the difference in life spans and fecundity between parasitized and unparasitized bugs, and get average times for some of the parasitism processes.
